			<h2>2.1.3 Unordered Sampling without Replacement: Combinations</h2>
			
			<p>Here we have a set with $n$ elements, e.g., $A=\{1, 2, 3,....n\}$ and we want to draw $k$ samples 
			from the set such that ordering does not matter and repetition is not allowed. Thus, we basically 
			want to choose a $k$-element subset of $A$, which we also call it a <b>$k$-combination</b> of 
			the set $A$. For example if $A=\{1,2,3\}$ and $k=2$, there are $3$ different possibilities
			<ol type="1">
                <li>{1,2}</li>
                <li>{1,3}</li>
                <li>{2,3}</li>
            </ol>
			We show the number of $k$-element subsets of $A$ by
			$${n \choose k}$$
			and is read "$n$ choose $k$". A typical scenario here is that we have a group of $n$ people, 
			and we would like to choose $k$ of them to serve on a committee. A simple way to find 
			${n \choose k}$ is to compare it with $P^n_k$. Note that the difference between the two is 
			ordering. In fact, for any $k$-element subset of $A=\{1, 2, 3,....n\}$, we can order the 
			elements in $k!$ ways, thus we can write
			$$P^n_k={n \choose k}\times k!$$
			Therefore,
			$${n \choose k}=\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}$$
			Note that if $k$ is an integer larger than $n$, then ${n \choose k}=0$. This makes sense, since 
			if $k>n$ there is no way to choose $k$ distinct elements from an $n$-element set.</p>
			
			<div style="padding: 15px; border: black 1px solid">
			The number of $k$-combinations of an $n$-element set is given by
			$${n \choose k}=\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}, \textrm{ for } 0\leq k\leq n$$
			</div><br>
			
			<p>${n \choose k}$ is also called the <b>binomial coefficient</b>. This is because the coefficients 
			in the binomial theorem are given by ${n \choose k}$. In particular, the binomial theorem 
			states that for an integer $n\geq 0$, we have
			$$(a+b)^n=\sum_{k=0}^{n} {n \choose k} a^k b^{n-k}$$</p>

			<p><i>Note:</i> There are several different common notations that are used to show the number 
			of $k$-combinations of an $n$-element set including $C_{n,k}, C(n,k), C^n_k, nCk$, etc. 
			In this book, we always use ${n \choose k}$.</p>

			<b>Example 33</b><br>
			<p>I choose $3$ cards from the standard deck of cards. What is the probability that 
			these cards contain at least one ace?</p>
			
			<i>Solution</i><br>
						<p> Again the phrase "at least" suggests that it might be easier to first find $P(A^c)$, 
						 the probability that the there is no ace. Here the sample space contains all possible 
						 ways to choose $3$ cards from $52$ cards, thus
						 $$|S|={52 \choose 3}$$
						 There are $52-4=48$ non-ace cards, so we have
						 $$|A^c|={48 \choose 3}$$
						 Thus
						 $$P(A)=1-\frac{{48 \choose 3}}{{52 \choose 3}}$$</p>
			<hr /><br>
			
			<a name="example34"></a>
			<b>Example 34</b><br>
			<p>How many distinct sequences can we make using $3$ letter "A"s and $5$ letter 
			"B"s? (AAABBBBB, AABABBBB, etc.)</p>
			
			<i>Solution</i><br>
						 <p>You can think of this problem in the following way. You have $3+5=8$ positions to 
						 fill with letters A or B. From these $8$ positions, you need to choose $3$ of them 
						 for As. Whatever is left will be filled with Bs. Thus the total number of ways is
						 $${8 \choose 3}$$
						 Now, you could have equivalently chosen the locations for Bs, so the answer would have been
						 $${8 \choose 5}$$
						 Thus, we conclude that
						 $${8 \choose 3}={8 \choose 5}$$</p>
			<hr /><br>
			
			<p>The same argument can be repeated for general $n$ and $k$ to conclude
			$${n \choose k}={n \choose n-k}$$
			You can check this identity directly algebraically, but the way we showed it here is interesting 
			in the sense that you do not need any algebra. This is sometimes a very effective way 
			of proving some identities of binomial coefficients. This is proof by <i>combinatorial interpretation</i>. 
			The basic idea is that you count the same thing twice, each time using a different method and 
			then conclude that the resulting formulas must be equal. Let us look at some other examples.</p>
			
			<hr /><br>
			<b>Example 35</b><br>
			Show the following identities for non-negative integers $k$ and $m$ and $n$, using 
			combinatorial interpretation arguments.
			<ol type="1">
                <li>We have $\sum_{k=0}^{n} {n \choose k}=2^n$</li>
                <li>For $0\leq k< n$, we have ${n+1 \choose k+1}={n \choose k+1}+{n \choose k}$</li>
                <li>We have ${m+n \choose k}=\sum_{i=0}^{k} {m \choose i}{n \choose k-i}$ (Vandermonde's identity)</li>
            </ol> 
			
			<i>Solution</i><br>
						 <p><ol type="1">
                              <li>To show this identity, we count the total number of subsets of an $n$-element

							  Another way to count the number of subsets is to first count the subsets with $0$ elements, 
							  and then add the number of subsets with $1$ element, and then add the number of subsets

							  We can also prove this identity algebraically, using the binomial theorem, 
							  $(a+b)^n=\sum_{k=0}^{n} {n \choose k} a^k b^{n-k}$. If we let $a=b=1$, we obtain 
							  $2^n=\sum_{k=0}^{n} {n \choose k}$.
							  </li><br>
							  <li>To show this identity, let's assume that we have an arbitrary set $A$ with 
							  $n+1$ distinct elements:
							  $$A=\{a_1, a_2, a_3, ...,a_n,a_{n+1}\}$$
							  We would like to choose a $k+1$-element subset $B$. We know that we can do this in  
							  ${n+1 \choose k+1}$ ways (the right hand side of the identity). Another way to count the 
							  number of $k+1$-element subsets $B$ is to divide them into two non-overlapping categories 
							  based on whether or not they contain $a_{n+1}$. In particular, if $a_{n+1} \notin B$, then 
							  we need to choose $k+1$ elements from $\{a_1, a_2, a_3, ...,a_n\}$ which we can do in 
							  ${n \choose k+1}$ different ways. If, on the other hand, $a_{n+1} \in B$, then we need 
							  to choose another $k$ elements from $\{a_1, a_2, a_3, ...,a_n\}$ to complete $B$ and 
							  we can do this in ${n \choose k}$ different ways. Thus, we have shown that the total 
							  number of $k+1$-element subsets of an $n+1$-element set is equal to ${n \choose k+1}+{n \choose k}$.
							  </li><br>
							  <li>Here we assume that we have a set $A$ that has $m+n$ elements:
							  $$A=\{a_1,a_2,a_3,...,a_m, b_1, b_2,...,b_n\}$$
							  We would like to count the number of $k$-element subsets of $A$. This is ${m+n \choose k}$. 
							  Another way to do this is first choose $i$ elements from $\{a_1,a_2,a_3,...,a_m\}$ and 
							  then $k-i$ elements from $\{b_1, b_2,...,b_n\}$. This can be done in ${m \choose i}{n \choose k-i}$ 
							  number of ways. But $i$ can be any number from $0$ to $k$, so we conclude 
							  ${m+n \choose k}=\sum_{i=0}^{k} {m \choose i}{n \choose k-i}$.
							  </li>
                          </ol> </p>
			<hr /><br>
			
			<p>Let us now provide another interpretation of ${n \choose k}$. Suppose that we have a group of $n$ people 
			and we would like to divide them two groups $A$ and $B$ such that group $A$ consists of $n$ people and 
			group $B$ consists of $n-k$ people. To do this, we just simply need to choose $k$ people and put them 
			in group $A$, and whoever is left will be in group $B$. Thus, the total number of ways to do this is 
			${n \choose k}$.</p>
			
			<div style="padding: 15px; border: black 1px solid">
			The total number of ways to divide $n$ distinct objects into two groups $A$ and $B$ such that group 
			$A$ consists of $k$ objects and group $B$ consists of $n-k$ objects is ${n \choose k}$.
			</div><br>
			
			<p><i>Note:</i> For the special case when $n=2k$ and we do not particularly care about group names $A$ 
			and $B$, the number of ways to do this division is $\frac{1}{2}{n \choose k}$ to avoid double 
			counting. For example, if $22$ players want to play a soccer game and we need to divide them into 
			two groups of $11$ players, there will be $\frac{1}{2}{22 \choose 11}$ ways to do this. The reason 
			for this is that in this case if we label the players $1$ to $22$, then the two choices
			$$A=\{1,2,3,...,11\} \textrm{ and } B=\{12,13,14,...,22\}$$
			$$A=\{12,13,14,...,22\} \textrm{ and } B=\{1,2,3,...,11\}$$
			are essentially the same.</p>
			
			<p>For example, we can solve <a href="http://probabilitycourse.com/chapter2/unordered_without_replacement.html#example34">Example 34</a> 
			in the following way: We have $8$ blank positions to be filled with letters "A" or "B". We need to 
			divide them into two groups $A$ and $B$ such that group $A$ consists of three blank positions and 
			group $B$ consists of $5$ blank spaces. The elements in group $A$ show the positions of "A"s and the 
			elements in group $B$ show the positions of "B"s. Therefore the total number of possibilities is 
			${8 \choose 3}$.</p>
			
			<b><font size="3">Bernoulli Trials and Binomial Distribution:</font></b>
			<p>Now, we are ready to discuss an important class of random experiments that appear frequently in practice. 
			First, we define Bernoulli trials and then discuss the binomial distribution. A <b>Bernoulli Trial</b> is 
			a random experiment that has two possible outcomes which we can label as "success" and "failure", such as
			<ul>
                <li>You toss a coin. The possible outcomes are "heads" and "tails". You can define "heads" as success 
				and "tails" as "failure" here.</li>
                <li>You take a pass-fail test. The possible outcomes are "pass" and "fail".</li>
            </ul></p> 

			<p>We usually denote the probability of success by $p$ and probability of failure by $q=1-p$. If we have 
			an experiment in which we perform $n$ <u>independent</u> Bernoulli trials and count the total number 
			of successes, we call it a <b>binomial</b> experiment. For example, you may toss a coin $n$ times 
			repeatedly and be interested in the total number of heads.</p>
			
			<hr /><br>
			<b>Example 36</b><br>
			Suppose that I have a coin for which $P(H)=p$ and $P(T)=1-p$. I toss the coin $5$ times.
			<ol type="a">
                <li>What is the probability that the outcome is $THHHH$?</li>

                <li>What is the probability that the outcome is $HHTHH$?</li>
                <li>What is the probability that I will observe exactly four heads and one tails?</li>
                <li>What is the probability that I will observe exactly three heads and two tails?</li>
                <li>If I toss the coin $n$ times, what is the probability that I observe exactly $k$ heads and $n-k$ tails?</li>

			<p>The interpretation of the binomial coefficient ${n \choose k}$ as the number of ways to divide $n$ objects

			<p>Ten people have a potluck. Five people will be selected to bring a main dish, three people will

			<i>Solution</i><br>
						 <p>We can solve this problem in the following way. First, we can choose $5$ people for the 
						 main dish. This can be done in ${10 \choose 5}$ ways. From the remaining $5$ people, 
						 we then choose $3$ people for drinks, and finally the remaining $2$ people will bring desert. 
						 Thus, by the multiplication principle, the total number of ways is given by

			In particular, if $n=n_1+n_2+...+n_r$, where all $n_i\geq 0$ are integers, then the number of ways 
			to divide $n$ distinct objects to $r$ distinct groups of sizes $n_1, n_2,..., n_r$ is given by
			$${n \choose n_1,n_2,...,n_r}=\frac{n!}{n_1! n_2! ... n_r!}$$
			We can also state the general format of the binomial theorem, which is called the multinomial theorem:
			$$(x_1 + x_2  + \cdots + x_r)^n = \sum_{n_1+n_2+\cdots+n_r=n} {n \choose n_1, n_2, \ldots, n_r} x_1^{n_1} x_2^{n_2} ... x_r^{n_r} \hspace{30pt} (2.2)$$
			Finally, the binomial formula for Bernoulli trials can also be extended to the case where each 
			trial has more than two possible outcomes.</p>

			<b>Example 38</b><br>
			<p>I roll a die $18$ times. What is the probability that each number appears exactly $3$ times?</p>
			
			<i>Solution</i><br>
						 <p>First of all, each sequence of outcomes in which each number appears $3$ times has probability
						 $$\left(\frac{1}{6}\right)^3 \times \left(\frac{1}{6}\right)^3 \times \left(\frac{1}{6}\right)^3 \times \left(\frac{1}{6}\right)^3 \times \left(\frac{1}{6}\right)^3 \times \left(\frac{1}{6}\right)^3$$
						 $$=\left(\frac{1}{6}\right)^{18}$$
						 How many distinct sequences are there with three $1$'s, three $2$'s, ..., and three $6$'s? 
						 Each sequence has $18$ positions which we need to fill with the digits. To obtain a sequence, 
						 we need to choose three positions for $1$'s, three positions for $2$'s, ..., and three positions 
						 for $6$'s. The number of ways to do this id given by the multinomial coefficient
						 $${18 \choose 3,3,3,3,3,3}=\frac{18!}{3! 3! 3! 3! 3! 3!}$$
						 Thus the total probability is
						 $$\frac{18!}{(3!)^6} \left(\frac{1}{6}\right)^{18}$$</p>

			<p>We now state the general form of the multinomial formula. Suppose that an experiment has $r$ possible 
			outcomes, so the sample space is given by
			$$S=\{s_1,s_2, ... ,s_r\}$$
			Also suppose that $P(s_i)=p_i$ for $i=1,2,...,r$. Then for $n=n_1+n_2+...+n_r$ independent trials of 
			this experiment, the probability that each $s_i$ appears $n_i$ times is given by
			$${n \choose n_1,n_2,...,n_r}=\frac{n!}{n_1! n_2! ... n_r!} p_1^{n_1} p_2^{n_2} ... p_r^{n_r}$$</p>
