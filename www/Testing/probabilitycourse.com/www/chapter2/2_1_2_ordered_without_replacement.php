			<p>Consider the same setting as above, but now repetition is not allowed. For example, if $A=\{1,2,3\}$ and $k=2$, 
			there are $6$ different possibilities:</p>
			<ol type="1">
                <li>(1,2)</li>
                <li>(1,3)</li>
                <li>(2,1)</li>
                <li>(2,3)</li>
                <li>(3,1)</li>
                <li>(3,2)</li>
            </ol> 

			<p>In general, we can argue that there are $k$ positions in the chosen list: 
			$($Position $1$, Position $2$, ..., Position $k)$. There are $n$ options for the first position, $(n-1)$ options 
			for the second position (since one element has already been allocated to the first position and cannot be chosen 
			here), $(n-2)$ options for the third position, ... $(n-k+1)$ options for the $k$th position. Thus, when ordering 
			matters and repetition is not allowed, the total number of ways to choose $k$ objects from a set with $n$ 
			elements is
			$$n \times (n-1) \times ... \times (n-k+1)$$
			Any of the chosen lists in the above setting (choose $k$ elements, ordered and no repetition) is called 
			a $k$-permutation of the elements in set $A$. We use the following notation to show the number of 
			$k$-permutations of an $n$-element set:
			$$P^n_k=n \times (n-1) \times ... \times (n-k+1)$$
			Note that if $k$ is larger than $n$, then $P^n_k=0$. This makes sense, since if $k>n$ there is no way to 
			choose $k$ distinct elements from an $n$-element set. Let's look at a very famous problem, called 
			the birthday problem, or the birthday paradox.</p>
			
			<hr /><br>
			<span class='example'>Example </span><br>
			<p>If $k$ people are at a party, what is the probability that at least two of them have the same birthday? 
			Suppose that there are $n=365$ days in a year and all days are equally likely to be the birthday of a 
			specific person.</p>
			<div class="solvedprob">
				 <ul>
				 	 <li><a><b>Solution</b></a>
				 	 <ul>
					 	 <li>
						 Let $A$ be the event that at least two people have the same birthday. First note that if $k>n$, then 
						 $P(A)=1$; so, let's focus on the more interesting case where $k\leq n$. Again, the phrase "at least" 
						 suggests that it might be easier to find the probability of the complement event, $P(A^c)$. This 
						 is the event that no two people have the same birthday, and we have
						 $$P(A)=1-\frac{|A^c|}{|S|}$$
						 Thus, to solve the problem it suffices to find $|A^c|$ and $|S|$. Let's first find $|S|$. What 
						 is the total number of possible sequences of birthdays of $k$ people? Well, there are $n=365$ 
						 choices for the first person, $n=365$ choices for the second person,... $n=365$ choices for the 
						 $k$th person. Thus there are
						 $$n^k$$
						 possibilities. This is, in fact, an ordered sampling with replacement problem, and as we have 
						 discussed, the answer should be $n^k$ (here we draw $k$ samples, birthdays, from the set 
						 $\{1,2,...,n=365\}$). Now let's find $|A^c|$. If no birthdays are the same, this is similar 
						 to finding $|S|$ with the difference that repetition is not allowed, so we have
						 $$|A^c|=P^n_k=n \times (n-1) \times ... \times (n-k+1)$$
						 You can see this directly by noting that there are $n=365$ choices for the first person, $n-1=364$ 
						 choices for the second person,..., $n-k+1$ choices for the $k$th person. Thus the probability 
						 of $A$ can be found as
						 <table align="center">			
                          <tr>
                            <td>$P(A)$</td>
                            <td>$=1-\frac{|A^c|}{|S|}$</td>
                          </tr>
                          <tr>
                            <td></td>
                            <td>$=1-\frac{P^n_k}{n^k}$</td>
                          </tr>
                          </table><br>
						 </li>
					 </ul>
					 </li>
				 </ul>
			</div>
			<hr /><br>
			
			<p><i>Discussion:</i> The reason this is called a paradox, is that $P(A)$ is numerically different from what most 
			people expect. For example, if there are k=$23$ people in the party, what do you guess is the probability 
			that at least two of them have the same birthday, $P(A)$? The answer is $.5073$ which is much higher 
			than what most people guess. The probability crosses $99$ percent when the number of peoples reaches $57$. 
			But why is the probability higher than what we expect?</p>
			
			<p>It is important to note that in the birthday problem, neither of the two people are chosen beforehand. 
			To better answer this question, let us look at a different problem: I am in a party with $k-1$ people. 
			What is the probability that at least one person in the party has the same birthday as mine? Well, 
			we need to choose the birthdays of $k-1$ people, the total number of ways to do this is $n^{k-1}$. 
			The total number of ways to choose the birthdays so that no one has my birthday is $(n-1)^{k-1}$. 
			Thus, the probability that no one has the same birthday as mine is
			$$P(B)=1-\big(\frac{n-1}{n}\big)^k$$
			Now, if $k=23$, this probability is only $P(B)=0.0586$, which is much smaller than the corresponding 
			$P(A)=0.5073$. The reason is that event $B$ is looking only at the case where one person in the 
			party has the same birthday as me. This is a much smaller event than event $A$ that looks at all 
			possible pairs of people. Thus, $P(A)$ is much larger than $P(B)$. We might guess that the value of 
			$P(A)$ is much lower than it actually is, because we might confuse it with $P(B)$.</p>
			
			<p><b>Permutations of $n$ elements</b>: An $n$-permutation of $n$ elements is just called a permutation 
			of those elements. In this case, $k=n$ and we have
			<table align="center">			
            <tr>
              <td>$P^n_n$</td>
              <td>$=n \times (n-1) \times ... \times (n-n+1)$</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td></td>
              <td>$=n \times (n-1) \times ... \times 1$</td>
            </tr>
            </table><br>
			which is denoted by $n!$, pronounced "$n$ factorial". Thus $n!$ is simply the total number of 
			permutations of $n$ elements, i.e., the total number of ways you can order $n$ different objects. 
			To make our formulas consistent, we define $0!=1$.</p>
			
			<hr /><br>
			<span class='example'>Example </span><br>
			<p>Shuffle a deck of $52$ cards. How many outcomes are possible? (In other words, how many different ways you 
			can order $52$ distinct cards? How many different permutations of 52 distinct cards exist?) The 
			answer is $52!$.</p>			
			<hr /><br>

			<p>Now, using the definition of $n!$, we can rewrite the formula for $P^n_k$ as
			$$P^n_k= \frac{n!}{(n-k)!}$$</p>
			
			<div style="padding: 15px; border: black 1px solid">
			The number of $k$-permutations of $n$ distinguishable objects is given by
			$$P^n_k= \frac{n!}{(n-k)!}, \textrm{ for } 0\leq k\leq n$$
			</div><br>
			
			<p><i>Note:</i> There are several different common notations that are used to show the number of 
			$k$-permutations of an $n$-element set including $P_{n,k}, P(n,k), nPk$, etc. In this book, we 
			always use $P^n_k$.</p>
