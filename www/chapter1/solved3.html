			<b>Problem 1</b><br>
			<p>You purchase a certain product. The manual states that the lifetime $T$ of the product, 
			defined as the amount of time (in years) the product works properly until it breaks down, satisfies
			$$P(T \geq t)=e^{-\frac{t}{5}} \textrm{ for all } t \geq 0$$
			For example, the probability that the product lasts more than (or equal to) $2$ years is 
			$P(T \geq 2)=e^{-\frac{2}{5}}=0.6703$. I purchase the product and use it for two years without 
			any problems. What is the probability that it breaks down in the third year?</p>

			<b>Problem 5</b><br>
			<p>In my town, it's rainy one third of the days. Given that it is rainy, there will be heavy 
			traffic with probability $\frac{1}{2}$, and given that it is not rainy, there will be heavy 
			traffic with probability $\frac{1}{4}$. If it's rainy and there is heavy traffic, I arrive 
			late for work with probability $\frac{1}{2}$. On the other hand, the probability of being 
			late is reduced to $\frac{1}{8}$ if it is not rainy and there is no heavy traffic. In 
			other situations (rainy no traffic, not rainy and traffic) the probability of being late 
			is $0.25$. You pick a random day.

						 <p>Let $R$ be the event that it's rainy, $T$ be the event that there is heavy traffic, 
						 and $L$ be the event that I am late for work. As it is seen from the problem statement, 
						 we are given conditional probabilities in a chain format, thus it is useful to draw 
						 a tree diagram. Figure 1.27 shows a tree diagram for this problem. 
						 In this figure, each leaf in the tree corresponds to a single outcome in the sample space. 
						 We can calculate the probabilities of each outcome in the sample space by multiplying 
						 the probabilities on the edges of the tree that lead to the corresponding outcome.</p>

						 <p>This is another typical problem for which the law of total probability is useful.

			<b>Problem 7</b><br>
			<p>Here is another variation of the family-with-two-children

			A family has two children. We ask from the father, "Do you have at least one daughter named Lilia?" 
			He replies, "Yes!"  What is the probability that both children are girls? In other words, we want to find 
			the probability that both children are girls, given that the family has at least one daughter named Lilia. 
			Here you can assume that if a child is a girl, her name will be Lilia with probability $\alpha \ll 1$ 
			independently from other children's names. If the child is a boy, his name will not be Lilia. Compare your 
			result with the second part of <a href="http://probabilitycourse.com/chapter1/conditional_probability.html#example18">Example 18</a>.</p>

						 <p>Here we have four possibilities, $GG=(\textrm{girl, girl}), GB, BG, BB$,

						 $$P(L|BG)=P(GB)=\alpha$$
						 $$P(L|GG)=\alpha (1-\alpha)+ (1-\alpha) \alpha +\alpha^2=2 \alpha-\alpha^2$$
						 We can use Bayes' rule to find $P(GG|L)$:<br><br>

						  </p>
						 
						 <p>Let's compare the result with part (b) of Example 18. Amazingly, we notice that the 
						 extra information about the name of the child increases the conditional probability of 
						 $GG$ from $\frac{1}{3}$ to about $\frac{1}{2}$. How can we explain this intuitively? 
						 Here is one way to look at the problem. In  part (b) of Example 18, 
						 we know that the family has at least one girl. Thus, the sample space reduces to three 
						 equally likely outcomes: $GG, GB, BG$, thus the conditional probability of $GG$ is 
						 one third in this case. On the other hand, in this problem, the available information 
						 is that the event $L$ has occurred. The conditional sample space here still is $GG, GB, 
						 BG$, but these events are not equally likely anymore. A family with two girls is more 
						 likely to name at least one of them Lilia than a family who has only one girl 
						 ($P(L|BG)=P(GB)=\alpha$, $ P(L|GG)=2 \alpha-\alpha^2$), thus in this case the conditional 
						 probability of $GG$ is higher. We would like to mention here that these problems are confusing 
						 and counterintuitive to most people. So, do not be disappointed if they seem confusing to you. 
						 We seek several goals by including such problems.</p>
						 
						 <p>First, we would like to emphasize that we should not rely too much on our intuition when solving 
						 probability problems. Intuition is useful, but at the end, we must use laws of probability to solve 
						 problems. Second, after obtaining counterintuitive results, you are encouraged to think deeply 
						 about them to explain your confusion. This thinking process can be very helpful to improve our 
						 understanding of probability. Finally, I personally think these paradoxical looking problems makes 
						 probability more interesting.</p>

			<b>Problem 8</b><br>
			If you are not yet confused, let's look at another family-with-two-children problem! I know that a

			What is the probability that both children are girls? Again compare your result with the second 
			part of <a href="http://probabilitycourse.com/chapter1/conditional_probability.html#example18">Example 18</a>. 
			Note: Let's agree on what precisely the problem statement means. Here is a more precise statement of the 
			problem: "A family has two children. We choose one of them at random and find out that she is a girl. 
			What is the probability that both children are girls?"

						 <p>Let's first agree on what precisely the problem statement means. Here is a more precise statement 
						 of the problem: "A family has two children. We choose one of them at random and find out that 
						 she is a girl. What is the probability that both children are girls?" Here again, we have four 
						 possibilities, $GG=(\textrm{girl, girl}), GB, BG, BB$, and $P(GG)=P(GB)=P(BG)=P(BB)=\frac{1}{4}$. 
						 Now, let $G_r$ be the event that a randomly chosen child is a girl. Then we have
						 $$P(G_r|GG)=1$$
						 $$P(G_r|GB)=P(G_r|BG)=\frac{1}{2}$$
						 $$P(G_r|BB)=0$$
						 We can use the Bayes' rule to find $P(GG|G_r)$:<br><br>
						 <table align="center">			
                          <tr>
                            <td>$P(GG|G_r)$</td>
                            <td>$=\frac{P(G_r|GG)P(GG)}{P(G_r)}$</td>
                          </tr>
                          <tr>
                            <td></td>
                            <td>$= \frac{P(G_r|GG)P(GG)}{P(G_r|GG)P(GG)+P(G_r|GB)P(GB)+P(G_r|BG)P(BG)+P(G_r|BB)P(BB)}$</td>
                          </tr>
						  <tr>
                            <td></td>
                            <td>$=  \frac{1.\frac{1}{4}}{1. \frac{1}{4}+ \frac{1}{2} \frac{1}{4}+ \frac{1}{2} \frac{1}{4}+0.\frac{1}{4}}$</td>

						  <tr>
                            <td></td>

						 <p>So the answer again is different from the second part of Example 18. This is surprising to 
						 most people. The two problem statement look very similar but the answers are completely different. 
						 This is again similar to the previous problem (please read the explanation there). The conditional 
						 sample space here still is $GG, GB, BG$, but the point here is that these are not equally likely 
						 such as they are in Example 18. The probability that a randomly chosen child 
						 from a family with two girls is a girl is one, while this probability for a family who has 
						 only one girl is $\frac{1}{2}$. Thus, intuitively, the conditional probability of the outcome 
						 $GG$ in this case is higher than $GB$ and $BG$, and thus this conditional probability must be 
						 larger than one third.</p>

			<b>Problem 9</b><br>

			first time that two consecutive heads ($HH$) or two consecutive tails ($TT$) are observed. I win if 
			$HH$ is observed and lose if $TT$ is observed. For example if the outcome is $HTH\underline{TT}$, I 
			lose. On the other hand, if the outcome is $THTHT\underline{HH}$, I win. Find the probability that I
