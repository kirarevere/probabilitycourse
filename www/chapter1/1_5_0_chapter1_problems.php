			<p>You are in a game show, and the host gives you the choice of three doors. Behind one door is a car and 
			behind the others are goats. You pick a door, say Door $1$. The host who knows what is behind the doors 
			opens a different door and reveals a goat (the host can always open such a door because there is only 
			one door behind which is a car). The host then asks you: "Do you want to switch?" The question is, 
			is it to your advantage to switch your choice?</p>

			<p>You and I play the following game: I toss a coin repeatedly. The coin is unfair and $P(H)=p$. The 
			game ends the first time that two consecutive heads (HH) or two consecutive tails (TT) are observed. 
			I win if (HH) is observed and you win if (TT) is observed. Given that I won the game find the probability 
			that the first coin toss resulted in head?</p>

			that the $(n+1)^{th}$ coin toss will also result in head?</p>

			Lilia. Here you can assume that if a child is a girl, her name will be Lilia with probability $\alpha \ll 1$ 
			independently from other children's names. If the child is a boy, his name will not be Lilia.</p>
