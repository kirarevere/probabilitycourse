			<h2>3.1.2 Discrete Random Variables</h2>
			<p>There are two important classes of random variables that we discuss in this book: <i>discrete random variables</i> 
			and <i>continuous random variables</i>. We will discuss discrete random variables in this chapter and 
			continuous random variables in Chapter 4. There will be a third class of random variables that are called 
			<i>mixed random variables</i>. Mixed random variables, as the name suggests, can be thought of as mixture 
			of discrete and continuous random variables. We will discuss mixed random variables in Chapter 4 as well.</p>
			
			<p>Remember that a set $A$ is countable if either
			<ul>
                <li>$A$ is a finite set such as $\{1,2,3,4\}$,</li>
                <li>or it can be put in one-to-one correspondence with natural numbers (in this case the set is said to be countably infinite)</li>
            </ul>
			In particular, as we discussed in Chapter 1, sets such as $\mathbb{N}, \mathbb{Z}, \mathbb{Q}$ and their 
			subsets are countable, while sets such as nonempty intervals $[a,b]$ in $\mathbb{R}$ are uncountable. 
			A random variable is discrete if its range is a countable set. 
			In <a href="http://probabilitycourse.com/chapter3/random_variables.html#ex45">Example 45</a>, the random 
			variables $X$ and $Y$ are discrete, while the random variable $T$ is not discrete.</p>
