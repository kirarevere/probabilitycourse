			<p>In this problem, we would like to show that the geometric random variable is <b>memoryless</b>. Let 
			$X \sim Geometric(p)$. Show that
			$$P(X > m+l | X > m)=P(X > l), \textrm{ for } m,l \in \{1,2,3, \cdots \}$$
			We can interpret this in the following way: Remember that a geometric random variable can be obtained 
			by tossing a coin repeatedly until observing the first heads. If we toss the coin several times, 
			and do not observe a heads, from now on it is like we start all over again. In other words, the 
			failed coin tosses do not impact the distribution of waiting time from this point forward. The 
			reason for this is that the coin tosses are independent.</p>

			<p>Here is a famous problem called the St. Petersburg Paradox. Wikipedia states the problem as

			each stage. The pot starts at $1$ dollar and is doubled every time a head appears. The first 
			time a tail appears, the game ends and the player wins whatever is in the pot. Thus the player 
			wins 1 dollar if a tail appears on the first toss, 2 dollars if a head appears on the first 
			toss and a tail on the second, $4$ dollars if a head appears on the first two tosses and a 
			tail on the third, 8 dollars if a head appears on the first three tosses and a tail on the 
			fourth, and so on. In short, the player wins $2^{k-1}$ dollars if the coin is tossed $k$ 
			times until the first tail appears. What would be a fair price to pay the casino for entering the game?"
