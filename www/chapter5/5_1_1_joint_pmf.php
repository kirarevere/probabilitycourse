Remember that for a discrete random variable $X$, we define the PMF as $P_X(x)=P(X=x)$. Now, if we have two random variables $X$ and $Y$, and we would like to study them jointly, we define the \textbf{joint probability mass function} as follows:

\begin{center}

\vspace{10pt}
The \textbf{joint probability mass function} of two discrete random variables $X$ and $Y$ is defined as
\begin{align}%\label{}
\nonumber P_{XY}(x,y)=P(X=x, Y=y).
\end{align}
\vspace{10pt}
}}
\vspace{10pt}
\end{center}
Note that as usual, the comma means ``and'', so we can write
\begin{align}%\label{}
\nonumber P_{XY}(x,y)&=P(X=x, Y=y) \\
\nonumber &= P\big((X=x)\textrm{ and }(Y=y)\big).
\end{align}
We can define the joint range for $X$ and $Y$ as
\begin{align}%\label{}
\nonumber R_{XY}=\{(x,y) | P_{XY}(x,y)>0\}.
\end{align}
